# About the APP

This app was built in react using context API for state management, CSS Modules and vanilla CSS
and using the naming convention of the BEM architecture for the CSS classes
using AXIOS to consume the API.

### Why BEM architecture ?

Using the BEM architecture lead to a more structured and maintainable CSS code.

### Why Context instead of redux ?

Context provides less code boilerplate and more simplicity to work with state management.

### To provide a better testing experience

It is recommended to use the Chrome DevTool to test the responsivity of the site.
